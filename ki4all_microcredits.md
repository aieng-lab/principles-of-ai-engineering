## Systems with Machine Learning

Section name: "Content/Inhalt:"
This microcredit discusses different aspects of systems with machine learning components. It starts with a discussion of the role of machine learning within a system. Afterwards, the difference between system goals and model goals is considered. Based on this, the chapter covers how such systems are embedded in the real world, how they interact with humans, and how they need to be operated. Finally, the chapter discusses how software engineering typically handles complexity and how this is different for systems with machine learning components.

## Model quality

Section name: "Content/Inhalt:"
Ths microcredit discusses different aspects of model quality. The model quality is first considered from a data science perspective, including a discussion of generalization and pitfalls for the evaluation. Then, the model quality is considered from a software engineering perspective, including a discussion of the role of testing, the oracle problem, and metamorphic testing. 

Section name: "Learning Objectives/Qualifikationsziele:"
The students know the basic concepts of model quality. They are able to explain the difference between data science and software engineering perspective on model quality. They know the typical problems with generalization and how to avoid typical pitfalls for the model evaluation. They can describe the role of testing for model quality. They can explain the oracle problem and how metamorphic testing can be used to address it.

## Requirements and Risks

Section name: "Content/Inhalt:"
This microcredit discusses different aspects of requirements and risks with respect to systems with machine learning components. The chapter discusses the role of requirements for machine learning. Then, there is a strong focus on handling risks and strategies to mitigate them by handling faults. Afterwards, the importance of constratins and trade-offs is dicussed. 

Section name: "Learning Objectives/Qualifikationsziele:"
The students know how software requirements, specifications, and the environment are related and what the difficulties for systems with machine learning components are. They can analyze the risks of such components and know common strategies on how to handle and mitigate them. The can explain various typical constraints for such systems and the trade-offs between different aspects.

## Model deployment and software architecture

Section name: "Content/Inhalt:"
This microcredit discusses different aspects of model deployment and software architecture. The chapter starts with a discussion of the role of software architecture for systems with machine learning components. It demonstrates how it can be trivial to deploy machine learning models, but that such deployments are often to simple for real-world applications. The chapter then discusses different aspects of software architecture and design decisions relevant for systems with machine learning components, including the documentation of machine learning interfaces.
