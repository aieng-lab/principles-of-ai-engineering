# Principles of AI Engineering

This repository contains the lecture slides and exercises for the course Principles of AI Engineering. The course offers an introduction to the engineering aspects of AI systems. The development of the materials for this course was supported by the [KI4ALL](http://ki4all.net/) project funded by the [BMBF](https://www.bmbf.de/).

The overall course consists of seven chapters. Each chapter covers a self-contained topic and can be studied independently as a [microcredit](https://ki4all.gitlab-pages.rz.tu-bs.de/hub/content/01_microcredits/0_intro.html), if an insitution offers such a possibility. The chapters are:

- Introduction to AI Engineering
- Systems with Machine Learning
- Model quality
- Goals
- Requirements and Risks
- Model deployment and software architecture
- Ethics

## Structure of the materials

The materials contain lecture slides and exercises. Additionally, a compiled version that structures the materials by topic into microcredits is available. All materials are provided in English.

### Lecture slides

The lecture slides are contained in the slides folder. They are provided in form of PowerPoint files (.pptx). There is one slide set per chapter. 

### Exercises

The exercises are provided as LaTex files. They can be compiled into PDFs either manually per sheet or together for all exercise sheets using the build_all.sh script. 

The exercises build on each other and support the lecture with a structured approach towards a project that is conducted to apply the knowledge gained in the lecture. 

### Compiled materials

Contains the slides and exercises, as well as possibly additionally required files for a chapter/a microcredit. The compiled materials contain the exercises in a different order to directly align them with the contents of the chapters. The exercises are designed in a way that they can also be solved in this different order, though the practical parts may still sometimes require that the practical parts from prior chapters were solved as a larger system is build step-by-step.
